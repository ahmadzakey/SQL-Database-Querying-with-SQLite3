# SQL Database Querying with SQLite3

## # Overview
This project demonstrates how to use SQLite3 and Python's Pandas library for querying and manipulating movie data. The database contains essential information like **name**, **IMDB rating**, **earnings**, and **genre**. Data is queried using SQL and then manipulated and analyzed using Pandas for insights.

## # Features
- **SQLite3 Database**: Stores movie data such as name, IMDB rating, earnings, and genre.
- **SQL Queries**: Efficient queries to extract and clean data.
- **Pandas Data Manipulation**: Data transformation, cleaning, and analysis using Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying key patterns in the dataset, such as high-earning movies or movies with high IMDB ratings.

## # Tools and Libraries
- **SQLite3**: Database management system for storing movie data.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: Used for querying data from the SQLite3 database.
- **Matplotlib (Optional)**: For creating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms).
